# 0.4: New note diagram

Create a diagram depicting the situation on a page https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes by writing something into the text field and clicking the submit button.

Show operations on the browser or on the server as comments on the diagram.

The diagram does not have to be a sequence diagram. Any sensible way of presenting the events is fine.
